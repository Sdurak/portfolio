  profileParagraph1:
    "Hello, I'm Segah. I graduated from Ankara University with a degree in Geological Engineering in 2014. I worked as an engineer in the construction sector, specifically in quality control and cost planning for road construction projects, for about 6 years. During this time, I noticed the software gap in Turkey, especially the low representation of women in the field, and decided to transition to the software industry.",
  profileParagraph2:
    "As a result, I enrolled in a 6-month full-stack software development program. Here, I learned various technologies and programming languages, including JavaScript, ReactJs, HTML, CSS, NodeJs, Redux, Redux-Toolkit, SQL, SQLite, and Java. I am a team player who can adapt well, solve problems, and communicate effectively with my colleagues. I have a strong passion for continuously learning new information, especially related to the industry I work in. My future goal is to combine my technical knowledge and working skills in this challenging journey and continue to develop myself in the field of software.",
